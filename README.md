A Raindrop game.  
Raindrops fall from the top.  The user must catch them in the bucket before the ground get saturated.  
When the bucket is full, the user goes up a level.  
Each level has a smaller bucket to move around.  There are also smaller and more numerous raindrops.  

This code is still under development.  
Things still to do:  
1. decide what to do when ground completely saturated (at the moment, level is decreased back to 1).  
2. decide what to do when all levels achieved.  
3. add code to position raindrops randomly on creation.
